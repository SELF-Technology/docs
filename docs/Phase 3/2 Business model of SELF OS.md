# Business model of SELF OS

As we look to the future and the creation of SELF OS, we already have some preliminary ideas for structuring a business model that will support such a bold mission. The starting point is to consider standard operating systems and how they monetise, including aggregating personal data to sell to 3rd parties such as advertisers. This is not something that SELF will ever do.&#x20;

SELF has the ambition to be a profitable business, with the profits funnelled back into product improvement and marketing, provided none of these profitable ventures is at the user's expense. In contrast, they should be adding immense value to the users.&#x20;

_Note - SELF's fuller proposition will be further detailed during 2025, and this section will be updated periodically._

The avenues we will explore for the SELF OS business model include:

* Transaction fees and commissions from payment services (for transactions within the OS)
* Licensing fees for hardware manufacturers (for shipping their products with SELF OS)
* Developer license fees
* Token launch royalties
* D2C sales of hardware, software, and connectivity services
