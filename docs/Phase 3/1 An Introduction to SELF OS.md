# SELF OS

SELF OS will work similarly to a typical operating system in terms of having numerous applications (any application compatible with Linux will be compatible with SELF OS) that assist with various tasks, from communication to note-taking and scheduling to purchasing. However, all the applications will be linked to one another by each user’s SELF, meaning that their individual preferences are part of how the applications work. This will enable an entirely new experience of interacting with an operating system.&#x20;

Opening a messaging app is unlinked to what you’re looking to buy. However, on SELF OS, you could exchange messages with your friend to discuss what to buy for tonight’s dinner, and your SELF would be checking where and how to buy those items while discussing them. Assuming that’s what you would like your SELF to be doing.

As another example, if a user is speaking to SELF about their day ahead, the operating system will take what they verbally say and crossmatch that with every application the user has installed on SELF OS. If any applications can assist the user, the applications are triggered in the background by the user’s SELF. The user is then told what tasks are pending completion and which are completed without needing to type anything, open anything, or interact in any way other than speaking out loud.

SELF OS will run on decentralised cloud infrastructure, enabling each user to run their own node and enabling the security and scalability of the network whilst increasingly reducing costs.

Over time, hardware products will be offered directly or by licensed partners. This may include secure, privacy-conscious, productivity-optimised devices with SELF OS preinstalled. Depending on the target audience, various models could be available, including a very affordable device with budget specs and no internet access (to be used as a productivity-focused word processor, completely avoiding any possibility of getting distracted by the internet). Another could be task-specific devices (e.g., for video editing, designing, writing, producing music, etc.), with specs and prices adapted to what is needed for that task.

Some or all products could have an integrated gamification and reward mechanism for completing tasks, enabling the ecosystem to be circular and self-fulfilling. Literally.

Looking far ahead to 2035 and beyond, expansion possibilities may include satellite internet infrastructure, amongst other innovations. Ultimately, we believe that technology and communication channels should be 100% self-sufficient, independent, and sovereign to each individual.
