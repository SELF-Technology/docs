# Avatar/Robot Companion

Imagine SELF as a customisable avatar or robot companion, akin to Samantha in the movie "Her," accompanying you throughout your day. SELF could interact with you through natural language conversation, gestures, and expressions, providing companionship, assistance, and even entertainment whenever needed.&#x20;

This virtual companion could evolve to have a synthetic voice, making conversations feel more human-like and personalised. SELF could also provide a platform for deeper emotional connections, offering support during difficult times and celebrating successes with you. And yes, it could even delve into more intimate realms, providing a safe space for personal chats or interaction for those seeking companionship in various forms.
