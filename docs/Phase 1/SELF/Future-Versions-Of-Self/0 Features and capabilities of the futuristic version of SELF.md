# Features and capabilities of the futuristic version of SELF

We believe that it's impossible to fully grasp the transformative potential of an adaptive and hyper-personalised AI. Hereâ€™s a summary of the features and capabilities we intend to incorporate into the futuristic version of SELF. Some might sound far-fetched, but so did many inventions throughout history before they materialised and became integral parts of our lives.

* **Advanced Expert Packs:** Suite of advanced productivity-enhancing expert packs.
* **Interfacing with applications through SELF:** Access and control any decentralised application integrated into the SELF App and SELF OS, as well as any other external Linux-compatible application running on SELF OS that allows for it, directly through chatting with or talking to SELF.
* **Life optimisation:** Have SELF provide personalised recommendations and interventions to improve productivity, health, and overall well-being.
* **Personalised assistant services:** Access a pool of trained human assistants, billed by the minute, who can interface with SELF and enhance the experience even further, as the user requires.
* **Advanced voice interactions:** All features of SELF will gradually become fully voice-enabled. Interacting with SELF in the future will closely resemble talking to a human personal assistant.
* **Neural technology:** As technology evolves, interacting with AI systems will become less manual and more intuitive. We are wary of the potential implications of non-self-sovereign neural technology but will explore humane innovations that are explicitly in the control and custody of the individual.
* **Customisable avatar/robot companion:** Develop an emotional connection with a virtual companion running SELF. This customisable on-screen avatar or robot companion could learn user preferences, provide companionship, and even evolve to offer deeper emotional connections.
