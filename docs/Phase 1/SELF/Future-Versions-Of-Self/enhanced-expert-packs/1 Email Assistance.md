# Email assistance

Tackling a mountain of emails can be overwhelming, especially if you run multiple email accounts and attempt to identify important documents buried in your inbox.&#x20;

Imagine if SELF were able to step in to help. SELF could scan your emails and highlight/organise what SELF believes you deem to be critical documents, attachments, legal files, case studies, or sales reports.&#x20;

This proactive approach saves you time and ensures key information is efficiently actioned. As you are the only person with access to your data, your privacy is assured - no intrusion or analytics by any organisation exists.
