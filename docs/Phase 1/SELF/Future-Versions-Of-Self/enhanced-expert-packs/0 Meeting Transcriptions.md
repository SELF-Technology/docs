# Meeting transcriptions

Picture this: you're in a crucial meeting, and instead of attempting to take down every detail, your adaptive SELF AI could have the ability to transcribe the entire conversation in real-time, highlighting the elements that it knows matter to you the most, and cross-matching it with past meeting notes to spot inconsistencies and trends.&#x20;

This feature would ensure accurate records, easier sharing of meeting notes and allow for better focus and engagement during discussions - ultimately leading to better decision-making.
