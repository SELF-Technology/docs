# A New Consensus Mechanism Called Proof of AI

With all of this in mind, it’s easy to understand how today's two most popular consensus mechanisms - Proof of Work and Proof of Stake - don’t match the original ethos of blockchain nor hold the answer to how future systems could operate more democratically. Instead, [Jonathan MacDonald](https://jonathanmacdonald.com) made the decision to develop a technical framework for a more efficient but also more democratic consensus mechanism that had been brewing since the early 2000s and the result is called [Proof of AI](https://proofofai.com) (PoAI).

Here’s a comparison between the three consensus mechanisms:

The patent-pending PoAI consensus mechanism inside SELF Chain is fair and equitable, in comparison to PoW which is about computing power and PoS which is about financial wealth.

One key factor of PoAI is that the algorithms constantly are in the process of learning and improving, directed to find the most efficient and cost-effective way of packing blocks. This is detailed further in the technical section of this document.&#x20;

PoAI can sense and respond to attack vectors and attempts at manipulation and adjust accordingly to mitigate threats. This includes attempts to force gas fees to increase and slow down the network by spamming transactions. PoAI does this by being dynamically updated with the present status of all parts of the network at any given time.

The mechanism can also be manually updated and improved by the core team, with transparently recorded audit trails of what is a) planned in terms of improvements and optimisation, b) why that plan is in place, c) the timeframe of making the adjustments and d) the intended outcome of the adjustments.
