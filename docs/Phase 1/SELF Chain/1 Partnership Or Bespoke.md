# Why not partner with another blockchain? Why do we need another layer 1?

After looking at many alternatives, we concluded that building what we wanted to build on an existing blockchain would require us to make greater sacrifices than we were willing to make. &#x20;

In the crypto landscape at the moment, users lose. They lose because they are avoidably coerced into paying exorbitant gas fees. They lose because of misleading marketing and false promises. They lose because they use services that claim to be decentralised even though they aren’t. Users of decentralised blockchain technology should win.&#x20;

Distributed ledger technology was never meant to favour the few – it was meant to be for the masses. The entire objective was that we shouldn't have to rely on third parties. There are, of course, great teams out there building unique and useful products; however, we have yet to find a project that has successfully solved the “[blockchain trilemma](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/glossary/blockchain-trilemma)” to a satisfying degree in terms of creating something that users easily can adopt in an intuitive, simple and effective way, which is part of enabling a network to scale.

It eventually became clear to us that it was necessary to create our own blockchain. To give some background to this decision, let us go back a couple of decades to the very inception of blockchain technology. For those reading who are well-versed in the history of blockchain technology, feel free to skip this section. It is here as a critical part of our reasoning, which led us to the conclusion that we essentially cannot use what has already been developed - we had to build something new, a blockchain that checked all the boxes we needed it to.
