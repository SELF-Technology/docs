# Potential ecosystem partners

* [Monad](https://www.monad.xyz/) - a decentralised, developer-forward Layer 1 smart contract platform with the potential of ushering in a new paradigm of possibility through pipelined execution of Ethereum transactions.
* [Nillion](https://nillion.com/) - a decentralised way to store and process private information, rendering traditional encryption obsolete using an encryptionless and hyper-secure technology called Information Theoretic Security.
* [Minima](https://www.minima.global/) - the embedded blockchain, empowering edge devices with full decentralization, a blockchain on infrastructure for everyday applications, helping realise DePIN’s potential.

_This list is preliminary, far from exhaustive, and subject to change. We’re in the process of examining several potential ecosystem partners inside and outside the crypto space._
