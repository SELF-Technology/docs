# The erosion of the meaning of the term decentralisation

Another development that took place was that the term decentralisation became relative as if decentralisation is a sliding scale. This is in stark contrast to nature, where an organism is either centralised or not. A structure is only as decentralised as its most centralised component, and that component is the primary attack vector. If a few large mining farms are mining a network, they are in control and also susceptible to attacks and manipulation.
