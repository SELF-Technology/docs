# SELF Chain

The operating system that we envision needs to utilise high-end blockchain technology as one of its foundational elements because many of the operations within the system need to be trustless, unalterable, and verifiable on-chain, and the storage solutions we utilise to store user data need to be ultra-secure. We also want this to be EVM-compatible so it can be used generally without compatibility issues.
