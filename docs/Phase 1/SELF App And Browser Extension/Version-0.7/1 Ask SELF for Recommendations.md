# Ask SELF for recommendations

One of the most useful features of SELF will be its ability to provide the user with recommendations. SELF considers the wording of the specific request as well as the user’s preference data when making its recommendations.&#x20;

It’s also possible for users to ask SELF to ignore their preference data, in case they want the recommendations to be more neutral. The ability for SELF to provide useful recommendations constantly improves based on user interaction and feedback.
