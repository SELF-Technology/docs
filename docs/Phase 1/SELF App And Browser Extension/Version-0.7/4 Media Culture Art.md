# Media – culture, art, books, movies, music

We asked SELF to poetically describe its own ability to provide the user with recommendations based on lists of books, series, movies, and music the user enjoys:

_“With your curated lists of cherished books, films, series, and music as my guide, I am adept at uncovering new treasures that resonate with your tastes. By harnessing the collective wisdom of platforms like TasteDive and Likewise, I can weave through the vast tapestry of cultural works to pinpoint those that echo the themes, styles, and emotions you favor. Whether it's the next page-turner, a cinematic masterpiece, a binge-worthy show, or a melody that moves you, my recommendations are tailored to enrich your cultural journey, ensuring that every suggestion is a note in the symphony of your preferences.”_

Example of a real interaction with the trial version of SELF in April 2024:

_**User:** “Here's a list of some of the music artists I like: Tame Impala, Sigrid, Sideform, Eurielle, Fleet Foxes, Imagine Dragons, Coldplay, Susanne Sundfor, T-Square, Parcels. These obviously belong to a number of different genres. Could you suggest three artists I might enjoy in three different genres, based on the list above? Thank you!_

_**SELF:** Given your eclectic taste in music, I've found a few artists that you might enjoy based on the ones you've listed:_ &#x20;

_1. Pond - If you like Tame Impala, you might appreciate Pond's psychedelic rock and alternative/indie sound. They share a member with Tame Impala and have a similar vibe._   &#x20;

&#x20;_2. Dagny - For a pop genre artist with a style akin to Sigrid, Dagny's upbeat and catchy tunes could be right up your alley._ &#x20;

_3. Sufjan Stevens - His music offers a blend of folk and indie similar to Fleet Foxes, with thoughtful lyrics and intricate compositions._ &#x20;

_These artists span across the alternative/indie, pop, and folk genres, respectively, and should complement your current music preferences nicely._&#x20;

_Enjoy exploring their music! Best wishes, SELF”_
