# Have a conversation with SELF

The user can talk with SELF about anything and the more SELF learns about the user, the more personal their interactions become. SELF learns about the user through everyday conversations and automatically remembers the user’s preferences, likes and dislikes. It will also be possible to answer a series of pre-set questions to help SELF get to know the user in a rapid fashion.&#x20;

These preferences will help SELF to better assist the user in the future. All data is securely saved within each user’s private SELF in an encrypted database that only the user can access. At some point in the future, the data will be stored through breakthrough decentralized technology (currently in development), which will make the data extraordinarily secure.
