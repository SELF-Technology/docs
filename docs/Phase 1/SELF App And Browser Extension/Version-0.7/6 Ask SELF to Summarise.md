# Ask SELF to summarise reviews of a specific product or service

Another speciality of SELF will be to provide the user with a well-structured summary review of a product or service. SELF will utilise a specialised review template when addressing such a request. The template will include a condensed description of the product/service and its features, a bit about the company behind the product (in the case that information is available online), a concise summary of what a variety of review articles have to say about the product (similarly to what Amazon offers for their products) and a selection of quotes from the conclusion paragraphs of these reviews.&#x20;

Instead of having to find and read four different review articles and visit a price review site to decide if itâ€™s a good purchase or not, the user can get an impression of the product or service in a short amount of time.
