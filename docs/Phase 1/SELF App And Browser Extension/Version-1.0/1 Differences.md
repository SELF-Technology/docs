# Differences between the mobile app and the browser extension

* Our intention is for all functionalities of SELF to be available on the app as well as the browser extension.
* The main difference is that the mobile app initially will open the default browser of the mobile when the user clicks on the links that SELF provides, while the browser extension will stay in the current browser window and open a new tab.
* In later versions, the mobile app will feature a fast and secure built-in browser, so that the user doesnâ€™t have to leave the application when clicking on the links SELF generates.
* Expert packs might function slightly differently on the mobile app compared to the browser extension.
