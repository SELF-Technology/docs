# Voice and More


**Voice support and additional features**

* Version 2.0 will introduce the ability to interact with SELF through speech instead of text. Initially, the capability will be limited to specific commands and prompts but it will eventually be possible to engage with SELF completely hands-free.
* Version 2.0 will come with improved capabilties in all areas of functionality and other additional features (yet to be announced) might also be introduced. At this point, SELF will be demonstrating what hyper-personalised connectivity feels like, and there will be guidance for how users can make SELF even more useful by connecting it to other applications.
