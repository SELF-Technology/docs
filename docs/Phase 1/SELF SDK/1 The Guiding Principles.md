# Guiding principles for all versions of the SDK

* Simplicity - The SDK should be easy to understand and use, with clear documentation and examples that enable developers to get started quickly and efficiently. &#x20;
* Security - The SDK should provide robust security features to protect user data and ensure the integrity of applications. &#x20;
* Reliability - Developers should be able to trust that the SDK and the underlying infrastructure is stable and reliable, with minimal downtime and consistent performance.&#x20;
* Usability - The SDK should be designed with the end-user in mind, ensuring that applications built with it are intuitive and provide a seamless user experience. &#x20;
* Code Reusability - The SDK should promote code reusability, allowing developers to write their code once and use it across multiple parts of their application or even across different projects.
* Modularity - The SDK should be modular, allowing developers to include only the components they need, which can reduce the complexity and size of the applications. &#x20;
* Continuous Validation - The SDK should include tools for continuous testing and validation, helping developers to catch issues early and maintain high-quality code throughout the development process.&#x20;
