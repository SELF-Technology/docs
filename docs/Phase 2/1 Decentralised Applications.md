# Decentralised applications built through the SDK

During Phase 2, we intend to market directly to developers, offer various incentives for developers to build with the SELF SDK, and focus on creating the best possible conditions for a vibrant developer community. One of the incentives for developers will be the possibility of eventually having their application become a part of the SELF App and SELF OS.

During this phase, we intend to initiate partnerships with the best-suited frontend frameworks and build a small selection of templates in order to assist developers who wish to create applications that fit together aesthetically and follow similar design principles. For an application to be considered for future integration into the SELF App and SELF OS, the developers will need to utilise one of these as the base template of their application.
