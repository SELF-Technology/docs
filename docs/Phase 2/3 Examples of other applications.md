# Examples of other applications

We wonâ€™t shy away from providing external development teams with ideas for potential applications and might even consider allocating resources for advising and assisting some teams during their development process. Our goal is to create the best user experience possible and increase the odds that excellent apps are created that qualify for integration into the SELF App and SELF OS. Applications that could be built, either by external developers or in-house, may include:

* Decentralised Finance Applications powered by SELF Chain
* Hyper-secure and decentralized file sharing and storage
* Decentralised and private messaging apps utilizing SELF in various innovative ways (see Footprint above)
* News feed aggregators give users control of their own algorithm
* Decentralised marketplaces for educational courses, NFTs, or storage/bandwidth/GPU/RAM
* Distraction-blocking word processor with gamification/reward mechanism
* To-do-list and calendar app with native SELF integration and gamification/reward mechanism
