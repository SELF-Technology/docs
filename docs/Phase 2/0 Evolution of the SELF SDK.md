# Evolution of the SELF SDK

The first version of the SELF SDK released during Phase 1 will be geared towards developers who want to build decentralised applications on SELF Chain. The developer SDK will only offer Solidity (or similar) blockchain development tools at that point.&#x20;

Phase 2 introduces new tools and development frameworks to enable developers to build clean and aesthetically coherent applications in a streamlined way.
