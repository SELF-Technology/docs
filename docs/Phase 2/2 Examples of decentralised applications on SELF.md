# Examples of decentralised applications on SELF

SELF will encourage developers to create their own standalone applications, monetisable by the developers themselves. At some point, a fair developer fee will be introduced.

We also intend to develop several native applications in-house to demonstrate what’s possible. These applications will leverage the functionalities of a system based on each individual’s range of preferences guiding their experience.
