# Phase 1

Many projects within the crypto sphere operate without demonstrating any financial viability whatsoever. We want to do things differently. \
\
During this initial period, we intend to run a lean and focused operation to make sure we are able to demonstrate the financial viability of these initial offerings before moving on to the next phase. Phase 2 and Phase 3 lead to more valuable opportunities and more lucrative possibilities for monetisation, yet the foundation is built during Phase 1.&#x20;

SELF will evolve significantly during this phase. To illustrate how we envisage this evolution, we provide preliminary details regarding features, use cases, and monetisation strategies for three arbitrary versions:

* Version 0.7 - the early version of the beta.
* Version 1.0 - the first version of the full release.&#x20;
* Version 2.0 - the version that marks the completion of the phase.
