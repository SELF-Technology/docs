# Phase 2

Once Phase 1 is complete, we aim to shift a significant portion of our resources into focusing more on creating the best possible conditions for a vibrant builder community of external developers utilising the SELF SDK. This is imperative in progressing towards SELF OS - community and developer focus is foundational to our architectural approach.

Initially, the SDK will be a Solidity-based (or similar) blockchain SDK that provides developers with the necessary tools to build decentralised apps and launch tokens on the SELF Chain.

During Phase 2, we will greatly expand the capabilities of the SDK, partner with the best UI and frontend developer frameworks on the market, integrate the SELF App, and incorporate various other tools to streamline the development process. We will also ramp up our efforts of approaching and integrating with suitable ecosystem partners.&#x20;
