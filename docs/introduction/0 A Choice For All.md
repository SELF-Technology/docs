# Everyone has a choice

Technology is evolving into two main directions; towards more centralised control, or towards decentralised, democratic, user-control.

Humanity is at a crossroads and everyone has a choice:

Should we continue to use centralised solutions and contribute to the progression of the ‘Big Tech’ ambition for power and dominance, where humans are data batteries and our rights are subjective?

Or should we choose solutions that empower individuals to have ownership and control over their digital experiences and their data?

This will increasingly become a consequential choice as the capabilities of AI evolve and the data that platforms and their partners collect on us increases exponentially.
