# Our six commitments

Everything we do is in service to our users, community and humanity at large, and in line with our core values. Our values determine how we make decisions, our design and development process, how we communicate and interact within the team, and how we operate.

We commit to:

1\. Make decisions that adhere to human rights.&#x20;

2\. Strive not to cause or enable harm while upholding those rights.

3\. Enable our users to control and own their data and decide how it is used. &#x20;

4\. Be transparent in our practices so that anyone can understand how we operate. &#x20;

5\. Uphold all applicable regulations and legislation in territories within which we operate. &#x20;

6\. Pursue commercial gain only to the extent that it doesnâ€™t compromise our core values.
