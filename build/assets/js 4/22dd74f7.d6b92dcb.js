Scott Stornetta envisioned the concept of a blockchain in 1991. They started by working on a blockchain secured by cryptography.

Bitcoin was seen as trivial at best or criminal at worst. Those of us who spoke about the direction of innovation were laughed at, and we struggled to understand what was so funny about trying to make things fairer, safer, and less abusable. In the early years, nobody saw Bitcoin as an asset class.

This is in stark contrast to nature, where an organism is either centralised or not. A structure is only as decentralised as its most centralised component, and that component is the primary attack vector. If a few large mining farms are mining a network, they are in control and also susceptible to attacks and manipulation.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Phase 1/SELF Chain/7 Proof Of Stake":{"id":"Phase 1/SELF Chain/7 Proof Of Stake","title":"Proof of Stake","description":"The same reality is apparent with Proof of Stake (PoS), an alternative consensus mechanism now popularised by Ethereum. PoS was meant to incentivise honest behavior by rewarding those who put their crypto up as collateral in order to earn a yield. What this meant, however, was that the control of the network rapidly shifted into the hands of the few.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Phase 1/SELF Chain/8 A New Consensus Mechanism Called Proof of AI":{"id":"Phase 1/SELF Chain/8 A New Consensus Mechanism Called Proof of AI","title":"A New Consensus Mechanism Called Proof of AI","description":"With all of this in mind, it\u2019s easy to understand how today\'s two most popular consensus mechanisms - Proof of Work and Proof of Stake - don\u2019t match the original ethos of blockchain nor hold the answer to how future systems could operate more democratically. Instead, Jonathan MacDonald made the decision to develop a technical framework for a more efficient but also more democratic consensus mechanism that had been brewing since the early 2000s and the result is called Proof of AI (PoAI).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Phase 1/SELF Chain/9 $SELF Native Coin":{"id":"Phase 1/SELF Chain/9 $SELF Native Coin","title":"$SELF Native Coin","description":"* Native coin of SELF Chain - used for paying gas fees on the blockchain.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Phase 1/SELF SDK/0 An Introduction":{"id":"Phase 1/SELF SDK/0 An Introduction","title":"SELF SDK","description":"The third product offering in Phase 1 is the SELF SDK, which will be developed alongside SELF Chain.&#x20;","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Phase 1/SELF SDK/1 The Guiding Principles":{"id":"Phase 1/SELF SDK/1 The Guiding Principles","title":"Guiding principles for all versions of the SDK","description":"* Simplicity - The SDK should be easy to understand and use, with clear documentation and examples that enable developers to get started quickly and efficiently. &#x20;","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Phase 1/SELF/0 What is SELF":{"id":"Phase 1/SELF/0 What is SELF","title":"What is SELF?","description":"SELF is a Sovereign Ethical Lifestyle Filter - a brand new technology.
